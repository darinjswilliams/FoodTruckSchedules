Data

The San Francisco governmentâ€™s website has a public data source of food trucks (https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Schedule/jjew-r69b). The data can be accessed in a number of forms, including JSON, CSV, and XML. How you access the data is up to you, but you can find some useful information about making an API request to this data source here (https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.sfgov.org/bbb8-hzi6).
